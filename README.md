# RosaeNLG

RosaeNLG is a [Natural Language Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_generation) library for node.js or client side (browser) execution, based on the [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) template engine.
Based on Pug-like textual templates and on input data, RosaeNLG will generate high quality texts.

Fully supported languages (with grammar, gender etc.) are *English*, *French*, *German*, *Italian* and *Spanish* but you can generate texts in any other language with less features.

RosaeNLG is complete enough to write production grade real life NLG applications.

RosaeNLG is a Sandbox Project of [LF AI & Data Foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation/), part of the Linux Foundation.

## Getting Started Using RosaeNLG

**The main documentation site is [rosaenlg.org](https://rosaenlg.org).** A mirror is available on [Github pages](https://rosaenlg.github.io/rosaenlg), but without the search bar. 

Use the Quick Start and the Tutorials on the documentation site.

You can also play around with a client side editor, compiler and renderer with an [in browser editor](https://rosaenlg.org/ide/index.html).

Sample template:
```pug
- var data = ['apples', 'bananas', 'apricots', 'pears'];
p
  eachz fruit in data with { separator: ',', last_separator: 'and', begin_with_general: 'I love', end:'!' }
    | #{fruit}
`, 'I love apples, bananas, apricots and pears!'
);
```
will generate:
```html
<p>I love apples, bananas, apricots and pears!</p>
```

## Roadmap

RosaeNLG aims to become the most used NLG open source engine, and to support more than 50 commonly spoken languages.

Major targets are:

- Improve the ability to add new languages
- Add more languages - depending on contributors
- Add new NLG *libraries*, like `rosaenlg-countries`
- Dedicated VSCode plugin, with template debug support
- Industrialize the [Java version](https://github.com/RosaeNLG/rosaenlg-java)

2021 Roadmap was presented and discussed during the first 2021 RosaeNLG meetup. See [detailed 2021 roadmap](https://rosaenlg.org/meetup/meetup_rosaenlg_1.html#_roadmap).
