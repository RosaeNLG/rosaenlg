= RosaeNLG Documentation

== Introduction

RosaeNLG is a Natural Language Generation library for node.js or client side (browser) execution, based on the https://pugjs.org/[Pug] template engine. It was previously known as FreeNLG.

Fully supported languages (with grammar, gender etc.) are *English*, *French*, *German* and *Italian*, but you can generate texts in any other language with less features.

RosaeNLG is complete enough to write production grade real life NLG applications.
