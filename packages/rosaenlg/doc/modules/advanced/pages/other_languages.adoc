= Other Languages

Fully supported languages are English, French, German, Italian and Spanish.
But you can generate texts in any language.

It is recommanded to use the proper locale: `nl_NL` for Dutch, `ja_JP` for Japanese etc.

== What will work

*Core features* will work:

* referring expressions
* synonyms
* recordSaid / hasSaid
* assembling: `eachz` and `itemz > item`
* setRefGender / getRefGender (even if it can be meaningless for some languages)


== What will work partially

*Rules, punctuation:* the default punctuation and capitalization rules applied are the ones for English. It will work quite well for most European languages, but not for Asian languages.

*Synonyms optimization (using `choosebest`):* it will work pretty well for all european languages, even if there is no stemmer for these languages. But it will not work for Asian languages as there is no tokenizer.


== What will not work

All *textual numbers* (cardinal textual, ordinal textual) will not work.

*Number formatting and ordinal numbers*, even when available in `numberal.js`, will not work as they are not included by default. But it is easy to add, see `import 'numeral/locales/xx';` in the code.

Same for *Dates formating*: it will not work. See `import 'moment/locale/xx';` in the code
