# RosaeNLG - library version

RosaeNLG is a Natural Language Generation library.
It is available:
- as a template engine, based on Pug: it is the most usual usage, see `rosaenlg` package
- as a code library (code API), to be used programmatically in JavaScript/TypeScript projects, without any templates: this is the `rosaenlg-lib` package

Writing plain code (without templating) to generate plain text is painful so most usages please consider using `rosaenlg` directly, and **not this `rosaenlg-lib` package**.
