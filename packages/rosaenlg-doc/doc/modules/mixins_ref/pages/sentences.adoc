= Sentences (beta)

== Purpose

There are 2 general ways of building sentences with RosaeNLG:

. Using mixins like `subjectVerb` or `verb`, which care for building a part of a sentence, and mixing them with static texts, or other pug structures like `if`. This is the most common way - you only use dynamic texts and mixins when you need them.
. Building the different components of a sentence, in a very structured way (a nice tree with a subject, a verb, complements etc.) and generating the sentence using a single mixin (actually the `sentence` mixin). This is more complex, only works for rather simple sentence structures, but allows further dynamism and control in some cases.

One advantage of the second approach is that the pronouns for direct and indirect object complements can be managed automatically: _I gave the neighbor an apple_ can become _I gave her an apple_ or _I gave it to the neighbor_ or _I gave it to her_.

== Current support

The current support of RosaeNLG for complete sentences is limited: 

* Languages: it *only works for French and English*
* Coverage is *limited* - which means in practice that some structures and combinations will not work
* The behavior of the `sentence` mixin is not completely aligned with the existing mixins like `verb` or `subjectVerb`
