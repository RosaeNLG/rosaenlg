= Listing things with `eachz` and `itemz > item`

You don't really need RosaeNLG to do loops: Pug has its `each` and `while` methods. But when doing NLG you often want to generate texts like _A, B, C and D_: there's one general kind of separator, the comma, and another one between the two last elements, the "and".
When you have only two elements you would like to generate _A and B_, not _A, B_.
This is why you need a proper way to list elements.

* When the elements to list are in a JavaScript array, use <<eachz>>. For instance you want to list products.
* When the elements to list are texts, mixins etc., use the <<itemz>> structure. For instance when you want to list the characteristics of a product, each characteristics of the product will have its own text.
* The ways to assemble the elements are the same for the `eachz` and the `itemz` structures: <<assembly_parameters>>.


anchor:eachz[eachz]

== The `eachz` structure

=== First example

++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`- var elts = ['A','B','C','D']
p 
  eachz elt in elts with { separator: ',', last_separator: 'and' }
    | #{elt}
`, 'A, B, C and D'
);
</script>
++++
This will output _A, B, C and D_.

`eachz` has this structure:

. The name of the iteration variable (here `elt`)
. An array of elements to iterate on, after `in` keyword
. An assembly structure after `with` keyword. See <<assembly_parameters>>
. And in the block anything you want ((displaying some kind of information about the element is generally a good idea).


=== Empty elements

It will only output non-empty elements. For instance:

++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`- var elts = ['A','B','C','D']
p
  eachz elt in elts with { separator: ', ', last_separator: 'and' }
    if ['B','C'].indexOf(elt)==-1
      | #{elt}
`, 'A and D'
);
</script>
++++
This will output _A and D_ (and not _A, D_).


anchor:itemz[itemz > item]

== The `itemz > item` structure

It is a nested structure like `case > when`. Use it to _list_ text elements.
++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`- let PRODUCT = {'gold': true};
itemz {separator: ', ', last_separator: ' and '}
  item
    | the ring has a huge central diamond
  item
    if PRODUCT.gold
      | it is made with gold
  item
    | it has 3 other diamonds
`, 'he ring has a huge central diamond, it is made with gold and it has 3 other diamonds'
);
</script>
++++

This will output _The ring has a huge central diamond, it is made with gold and it has 3 other diamonds_ if `PRODUCT.gold` is true.
As usual, empty elements will be ignored (here when `PRODUCT.gold` is false).


anchor:assembly_parameters[assembly parameters]

== Assembly parameters

WARNING: There are plenty of parameters combinations and some of them may not have been tested.

You can generate either:

* a single sentence: this is the default, you can also put `mode: 'single_sentence'`
* multiple sentences:
** sentences with a new HTML paragraph: `<p>...</p>`: put `mode: 'paragraphs'`
** without: put `mode: 'sentences'`
** generate bullet lists: put `mode: 'list'`
* use `mode: 'combined'` to assemble at 2 different levels; see <<combined>>

=== Common parameters

* `mix`: boolean. the elements of the list are randomly mixed before being listed. This is often used to add diversity to the texts.
* `separator`: default separator between to elements. Often "," when mode is single sentence, often "." otherwise.
* `begin_with_general`: what the sentence should begin with. Could be _The products are:_. Often combined with `begin_with_1` and `if_empty`
* `begin_with_1`: what the sentence should begin with when there is only one element. Could be _The only products is:_
* `if_empty`: what the sentence should begin with when there it is empty. Defaults to nothing. Could be _No products today_.
* `end`: what the sentence should end with when it is not empty.

=== Single sentence specific parameters

* `last_separator`: the last separator. Often " and ".

.Single sentence example
++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`p
  eachz elt in ['A','B','C','D'] with { separator: ',', last_separator: 'and' }
    | #{elt}
`, 'A, B, C and D'
);
</script>
++++
will output _A, B, C and D_.

=== Multiple sentences specific parameters

* `begin_with_general` can be an array. Each element of the array will be output at the beginning of each new sentence, until exhaustion.
* `begin_last` : last beginning of sentence. Could be _at last_.
* `begin_last_1`: the previous to last beginning. Could be _finally_.

.Multiple sentences example
++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`p
  eachz elt in ['A','B','C','D','E'] with {mode:'sentences', separator: '.', begin_with_general: ['first,','second,'], begin_last_1: 'as well,', begin_last: 'at last,'}
    | #{elt}
`, 'First, A. Second, B. C. As well, D. At last, E'
);
</script>
++++
will output _First, A. Second, B. C. As well, D. At last, E._.

TIP: Classic parameters can be either string or mixins. Using a mixin is convenient when the content is variable, often for `begin_with_1`. These mixins can even receive parameters:
++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`mixin mixinLastSep(params)
  if hasFlag(params, 'LAST_SEP_IS_ALT')
    | ALT_LAST_SEP
  else
    | LAST_SEP

p
  - var params = { LAST_SEP_IS_ALT: true };
  itemz {separator: ', ', last_separator: mixinLastSep}
    item
      | X
    item
      | Y
`, 'X ALT_LAST_SEP Y'
);
</script>
++++
This will output _X ALT_LAST_SEP Y_. The name of the variable *must* be `params`.

=== List specific parameters

* `list_capitalize`: boolean; put `true` to capitalize each element (defaults to `false`)
* `list_end_item`: string; ends each item of the list; typically put `.` to end each item with a dot
* `list_type`: `ul` for unordered list, `ol` for ordered list; defaults to `ul`
* `list_intro`: text before the list, can be a string or a mixin

++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`p
  itemz { mode:'list', list_intro: 'what I should do:', list_capitalize: true, begin_with_general: ['first, ', 'second, '], begin_last: 'finally, ', list_end_item: '.' }
    item
      | have a drink
    item
      | watch TV
    item
      | go to bed
`, 'What I should do: <ul><li>First, have a drink.</li><li>Second, watch TV.</li><li>Finally, go to bed.</li></ul>'
);
</script>
++++


anchor:combined[2 levels assembly]

== Advanced: 2 levels assembly

When dealing with long and dynamic lists of elements, you may wish to assemble elements in _two steps_, typically:

. generating a set of sentences, each made of a limited number of the elements
. and then assembling these sentences together

Use `mode: 'combined'`, and in the `asms` parameter, put 2 assemblies. The first will be the top level assembly (e.g. `mode: 'sentences'`), and the second will be the second level assembly (e.g. `mode:'single_sentence'`). The second must have a `max` parameter, which is the maximum number of elements to use before switching to top level assembly.

It works with both `eachz` and `itemz`.

++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`- const fruits = ['apples', 'bananas', 'apricots', 'pears', 'ananas', 'coconuts', 'figs', 'oranges'];
- 
  const asm = {
    mode: 'combined',
    asms: [
      {
        mode: 'sentences', 
        separator: '.', 
        begin_with_general: ['I love', 'I also like', 'and I appreciate']
      },
      {
        mode:'single_sentence',
        separator: ',', 
        last_separator: 'and',
        max: 3,
      }

    ]
  };

eachz fruit in fruits with asm
  | #{fruit}

`, 'I love apples, bananas and apricots. I also like pears, ananas and coconuts. And I appreciate figs and oranges.'
);
</script>
++++


== Advanced: assemble dynamically

=== Dynamic assembly

You can dynamically generate a complete assembly depending of the number of non empty elements to assemble. For instance, when the list is very long, you may want to use a bullet list, but when the list is shorter, a single sentence might be better.

To do that:

. create a JavaScript function that takes 1 parameter: the real length of the list, and returns the proper assembly
. reference that function in `assembly`

RosaeNLG will first check which elements are not empty, then call the function to get the assembly parameters, and then render using that assembly.

TIP: when elements have to be shuffled, using `mix`, the `mix` property must be at the top level, in the same structure as the `assembly` reference, as mix must occur before counting which elements are empty or not.

TIP: you can also get a second parameter which is the list of the non empty elements.

++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`
-
  function getAsm(len) {
    if (len > 3) {
      return { mode:'list', list_capitalize: true, list_intro: 'I love:' }
    } else {
      return { mode:'single_sentence', separator: ',', last_separator: 'and', begin_with_general: 'I love', end: '.' }
    }
  }
- let fruits = ['apples', 'bananas', 'pears', 'nuts']
p
  //- the long list, with a bullet list
  eachz fruit in fruits with {assembly: getAsm}
    | #[+value(fruit)]
p
  //- a shorter list will trigger a sentence
  eachz fruit in fruits.slice(0,2) with {assembly: getAsm}
    | #[+value(fruit)]

`, '<p>I love: <ul><li>Apples</li><li>Bananas</li><li>Pears</li><li>Nuts</li></ul></p><p>I love apples and bananas.</p>'
);
</script>
++++


== When assembling, knowing which elements are empty

When you list elements, it is sometimes (but very rarely) useful to be able to know which elements are empty and which are not. 

The list of the non empty elements:

* is sent to separators, when they are mixins and take an object parameter (see exemple)
* is made available in `listInfo.nonEmpty` in the `itemz > item` structure

++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`mixin asmMixin(params)
  if params && params.nonEmpty && params.nonEmpty.length==3
    | and also
  else
    | and
- let WITH_3 = true;
p
  itemz {mode:'single_sentence', separator: ',', last_separator: asmMixin}
    item
      | first
    item
      | second
    item
      if WITH_3
        | third

`, 'irst, second and also third'
);
</script>
++++
will output either _first, second and also third_ or _first and second_ depending on `WITH_3` flag.

* When in a a `eachz` structure, elements are objects, while when in an `itemz > item` structure, elements are integers.
* When you read `listInfo.nonEmpty` or `params.nonEmpty`, it can be `undefined`: this happens when RosaeNLG is actually testing if the elements are empty or not. RosaeNLG will make a second call with `xxx.nonEmpty` properly populated. Thus just test and ignore if `undefined`.
