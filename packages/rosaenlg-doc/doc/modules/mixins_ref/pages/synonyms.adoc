= Synonyms

Use synonyms to vary your output is a good practice. For some background about the approaches read https://ehudreiter.com/2018/10/15/varying-words-in-nlg/[Ehud Reiter's article about synonyms in NLG].

You can output simple synonyms (words etc.) with `syn` and complex ones (which use mixins or other synonyms etc.) using `synz > syn` structure.

The algorithm that chooses the synonym to output works like that:

* It is random based (nothing fancy but efficient), or sequence based (one after the other), depending on the mode.
* It eliminates empty alternatives.
* You can ask the algorithm to globally <<choosebest>>.

You should *not use your own random numbers in your mixins*, because it will break RosaeNLG's ability to predict the next outputs. xref:advanced:random.adoc[More about RosaeNLG and random numbers].

== Basic synonyms using `syn`

The `syn` mixin is perfect for very basic synonyms.
++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`p The diamond is #[+syn('shiny','gleaming','glossy')] .
`
);
</script>
++++
Arguments can be single words, multiple words or anything, but not mixins.
Please note that the argument is not an array: the mixin takes a variable number of arguments.

With this mixin the choice is always random. Use `synz > syn` structure if you want more options like sequential output.

== The `syn_fct` function

The `syn_fct` is not a mixin but a standard JavaScript function. Its argument is an array.
It is useful when you want random arguments in some other mixins. Remind, do not use you own random function.

Will randomly output _the apple_ or _an apple_:
++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US',
`p
  | #[+value('apple', {det: syn_fct(['DEFINITE', 'INDEFINITE'])}) ]
`, 'apple'
);
</script>
++++


== Complex synonyms with `synz > syn` structure

=== First example

When each synonymic alternative is complex text using mixins, `syn` doesn't fit. You have to use the `synz > syn` structure.

++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`p
  synz
    syn
      | first alternative
    syn
      | second alternative
    syn
      | third alternative
`, 'alternative'
);
</script>
++++

You can put sentences or words or whatever you want in each `syn`.


=== Note on empty alternatives

RosaeNLG will always try to find a non-empty alternative in a `synz > syn` structure. When it triggers an empty one, it will go back and try to find a new one.


=== Choose randomly but try not to repeat

Pure random mode is default but has a drawback: the same alternative can trigger again, leading to non harmonious text.
To avoid that use `mode:'once'`. It will trigger each alternative randomly, but will try not to repeat
the same alternative. When all alternatives have been triggered, it will reset, but will try not run the last triggered alternative as the first new one, avoiding repetitions.

++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`p
  synz {mode: 'once'}
    syn
      | first alternative
    syn
      | second alternative
    syn
      | third alternative
`, 'alternative'
);
</script>
++++

TIP: In general *you should favor `once` instead of default `random`*.


== Force a specific synonym to trigger

To force a specific synonym to trigger, use `synz {force:3}` (to trigger the 3rd one):
++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`p
  synz {force:3}
    syn
      | first alternative
    syn
      | second alternative
    syn
      | third alternative
`, 'hird alternative'
);
</script>
++++

TIP: This is useful while developping.

TIP: if the forced alternative is empty, it will not trigger it (and will trigger a non empty one).


=== Weights of each alternative

If you want to favor an alternative more than the other, you can put a higher weight on the one you prefer:
++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`p
  synz
    syn
      | first alternative
    syn
      | second alternative
    syn {weight: 3}
      | the one I prefer
`
);
</script>
++++
The _the one I prefer_ option will be triggered much more often (probability is 3/5).

`weight` must be a strictly positive integer.

TIP: It is generally a bad practice to use `weight` and `mode: 'once'` in the same structure: once an alternative has been triggered, it will be avoided whatever its weight.


=== Choose each synonym alternative one after the other

Sometimes random is not the right way. You might prefer to trigger the first alternative, then the second one, etc. Put the `mode` parameter to `sequence` to do that.

++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`p
  - for (let i=0; i<10; i++) {
    synz {mode:'sequence'}
      syn
        | first
      syn
        | second
      syn
        | third
      syn
        | fourth
  - }
`, 'irst second third fourth first'
);
</script>
++++
When called 5 times, will output: _first second third fourth first_

`weight` parameter is meaningless in `sequence` mode.


=== Global synonym mode

Possible values for more are:

* `random` (default)
* `sequence`
* `once`

By default, the synonyms are choosen randomly (`random`), and you can locally change this behavior using `sequence` or `once` mode. But you can change the behavior globally using `defaultSynoMode`.

When you have changed `defaultSynoMode`, you can still change the default behavior locally using another mode.

TIP: using `once` as `defaultSynoMode` and setting `sequence` locally is a popular setting.


anchor:choosebest[choose the best alternative]

== Choosing the best alternative globally with `choosebest`

=== Introduction and first example

WARNING: The standard synonym algorithm is and should be good enough for most usages. When there are non elegant repetitions in the generated texts, the first reflex should be to do local fixes with using `{mode:'sequence'}`.

`choosebest` works the following:

* it generates dozens of texts on a section, whatever its size or what is contains
* it chooses the textual alternative that contains the _least close repetitions_

For instance, if _stone_ _gem_ and _jewel_ are synonyms, ranking from best to worst: _stone gem jewel_ / _stone gem stone_ / _stone stone gem_ / _stone stone stone_.

Let's take a first example:
....
eachz i in [1,2,3] with {separator: ' '}
  synz
    syn
      | stone
    syn
      | jewel
    syn
      | gem
....

If you run that, you will get randomly _gem jewel jewel_ or _stone gem stone_ etc. - sometimes _gem jevel stone_ if you are lucky.

Let's use `choosebest`:
++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`p
  choosebest {among:100}
    eachz i in [1,2,3] with {separator: ' '}
      synz
        syn
          | stone
        syn
          | jewel
        syn
          | gem
`, 'ewel'
);
</script>
++++


It will generate a 100 times the same text and take the best alternative. Unless you are very unlucky, you are sure to get _gem jevel stone_ (still in a random order).

=== Usage

*You can put `choosebest` anywhere* to optimize synonyms in a section of text but you should use it at a paragraph level.

WARNING: `choosebest` has a *heavy impact on performance* as the texts are generated multiple times. Use it cautiously only when required.

TIP: you cannot imbricate `choosebest` structures. But in a same template you can use multiple `choosebest` structures one after the other, for instance on each paragraph.


=== Advanced options

==== How it works

The scoring algorithm works like this:

* single words are extracted thanks to a tokenizer `wink-tokenizer`, and lowercased
* stopwords are removed (you can customize the list of stopwords)
* when the same word appears multiples times, it raises the score depending on the distance of the two occurrences (if the occurrences are closes it raises the score a lot).

anchor:defaultAmong[default among]

==== Max attempt

To indicate the maximum attempts to find the best alternative:

* `among` local parameter: `choosebest {among:20}`
* `defaultAmong` global parameter: `rosaenlgPug.render(myTemplate, { language: 'en_US', defaultAmong:10 })`
* default is 5

==== Stop words customization

You can customize locally the list of stop words with:

* `stop_words_add` string[]: list of stopwords to _add_ to the standard stopwords list (NB: `stop_words_add` will be automatically lowercased)
* `stop_words_remove` string[]: list of stopwords to _remove_ to the standard stopwords list
* `stop_words_override` string[]: replaces the standard stopword list (which is per language)

++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`p
  choosebest {among:10, stop_words_add:['newStopWord']}
    synz
      syn
        | newStopWord newStopWord AAA newStopWord BBB
      syn
        | AAA AAA
`, 'ewStopWord newStopWord AAA newStopWord BBB'
);
</script>
++++
will output _newStopWord newStopWord AAA newStopWord BBB_.

....
choosebest param
  synz
    syn
      | thus thus thus AAA BBB
    syn
      | AAA AAA
....
will output _AAA AAA_, because _thus_ is not considered as a stop word no more.

TIP: The standard list of stop words per language is xref:stopwords.adoc[here].

==== Force identical elements

Sometimes you want to say that 2 or more words should be considered as identical in terms of synonyms even if they are not. Often for plurals: _diamonds_ _diamond_, as there is no integrated lemmatizer, or for similar words like _phone_ _cellphone_ _smartphone_.

Use `identicals` string[][] with list of words that should be considered as beeing identical:
++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`p
  choosebest {among:20, identicals: [ ['diamond', 'diamonds'] ]}
    | diamonds and
    synz
      syn
        | pearl
      syn
        | diamond
`, 'iamonds and pearl'
);
</script>
++++
will output _diamonds and pearl_ systematically.

==== How to debug

It is often difficult to understand why `choosebest` has chosen one alternative and not another, what is has explored, the different scores etc. You can activate traces using `debug:true` and get the result in `debugRes`:

++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`- var param = {debug:true, among:100}
p
  choosebest param
    | bla bla
  | !{JSON.stringify(param.debugRes)}
`, 'bla'
);
</script>
++++


== Generate all alternatives

You may want to generate exhaustively _all_ texts to insure that they are ok.

WARNING: Even on a modest project, the combination of all possible texts can be huge.

A general advice would be:

* When the output must be completely predictable and exhaustively tested (it can be the case for financial or medical applications), you may just consider avoid using synonyms, or use them less.
* Use regression testing and test _some_ of the outputs:
** some with a fixed random seed (`forceRandomSeed`): must be an exact match
** some random, but checking for invariants in the text (typically numbers, or facts)

If you really want to generate all texts, you can write a loop using `forceRandomSeed`:

* put `forceRandomSeed` to 1, then 2, then 3 etc.
* **changing random seed will not guarantee that a different text is generated each time:** keep the generated texts as keys in a Map to see if a text is new or not
* eventually stop looping when you don't discover enough new texts
