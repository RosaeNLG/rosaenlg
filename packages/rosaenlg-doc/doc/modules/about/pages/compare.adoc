link:https://github.com/societe-generale/core-nlg[CoreNLG] is a modern open-source Python NLG library published by Société Générale.

|=====================================================================
| Characteristic | CoreNLG | RosaeNLG
| *main* | |
| developed in | Python | JavaScript & TypeScript
| language for data prep and glue | Python | TypeScript or JavaScript
| language for text generation | Python code | Pug templates
| output languages | English and French | full support with linguistic ressources for French, English, German, Italian and Spanish
| open-souce | yes (Apache 2.0) | yes (Apache 2.0)
| client side execution (browser) | no | yes
| *standard / templating features* | |
| if / else, switch / case | yes (pure Python) | yes (Pug or JavaScript)
| textual functions | yes (Python functions) | yes (Pug mixins)
| template based | no (pure Python) | yes (based on Pug)
| *NLG features* | |
| enumerations | yes | yes
| capitalization, punctuation, contractions | yes | yes
| dates, numbers | yes | yes
| anaphora | basic using synonyms | yes
| agreement on verbs, adjectives and words | no (has to be done manually) | yes (rules & linguistic ressources)
| synonyms with modes | yes (random + draw without replacement) | yes (random + draw without replacement + sequence)
| synonyms global optimization | no | yes (per section, generates multiple alternatives and chooses the best one)
| ability to spot empty elements | yes | yes
| safely record what was said | yes | yes
| *packaging* | |
| as a library | ? (to be checked, cannot be found on PyPI) | yes (npm)
| command-line interface | no | yes
| Docker image | no | yes (distroless)
|=====================================================================

In summary CoreNLG is just perfect:

* if you use Python
* if you do not need sophisticated linguistic features likes anaphora, verbs, words and ajectives agreements
* if you are not afraid of maintaining texts templates as Python code

RosaeNLG can be better:

* if you want more readable templates
* if your NLG project requires linguistic resources
* if you use Javascript or TypeScript
* if you wish to make browser side rendering


== xSpin

_Spin generators_ are a category of tools that are able to generate a huge quantity of different texts for a same dataset. In general, you define a template with plenty of different paths, and the spinner will randomly go through the template and generate different texts. Spin generators are generally considered as basic pre-NLG software and are quite popular among web redactors. They are generally easier to use than NLG engines.

link:https://xspin.it/[xSpin] is a modern SaaS Spin generator with a visual design tool, and more advanced features than what is generally excepted from a Spin generator.

This comparison has been made in collaboration with Sylvain Deauré, the author of xSpin.

|=====================================================================
| Characteristic | xSpin | RosaeNLG
| Licence | proprietary licence | open-source (Apache 2.0)
| Pricing | monthly cost €32 excl. tax. | free
| Hosting | SaaS only | you can run anywhere, on your laptop, your server or on the cloud, but no SaaS as of today
| Integration | API + WordPress plugin + RSS feeds as an input | xref:integration.adoc[easy integration for JavaScript or Java, or API]
| Template definition | nice visual interface, with good overview of structure | templating language based on Pug, no visual editor
| Share / reuse elements | yes with modules | yes with mixins
| Conditional blocks (if/then/else) | yes | yes
| Enumerations | yes (with shuffle ability too) | yes
| Linguistic features | no agreements on verbs, words and adjectives | linguistic resources for supported languages
| Punctuation management | no | xref:advanced:filter.adoc[yes]
| Contractions | yes (automatic capitalization and contractions) | xref:advanced:filter.adoc[yes]
| Synonyms with modes | yes (random + specific algo to maximize the distance between outputs) | yes (random + draw without replacement + sequence)
| Synonyms global optimization | yes with Qualispin (add on service) | yes (per section, generates multiple alternatives and chooses the best one)
| Ability to spot empty elements | yes to a certain extend | yes
| Safely record what was said | to a certain extend using variables | yes
|=====================================================================

In summary xSpin is just perfect:

* if you do not wish to code and need a visual interface to design your templates
* if you do not need linguistic features likes anaphora, verbs, words and ajectives agreements

RosaeNLG is be better:

* if you are ok to write some code
* if you want to use standard developer tools like VSCode, Git versioning, CI, automated testing etc.
* if your NLG project requires linguistic resources
