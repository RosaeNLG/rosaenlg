= What is NLG

NLG stands for _Natural Language Generation_. The goal of NLG is to generate texts automatically from data, with the same quality as if a human being had written it.

Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is the exact opposite: transforming text into structured data. NLG and NLU are both subfields of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

You don't need a Natural Language Generator to generate basic texts, but doing it without a Natural Language Generator quickly becomes tricky. The pratical issues in NLG are:

* the use of synonyms and referring expression to avoid repetitions
* the proper agreement of verbs, nouns, adjectives (depending on the output language)
* proper punctuation and spacing
* the ability to properly _list_ things (_xxx, yyy and zzz_)

See xref:advanced_nlg_examples.adoc[examples of templates] showing the added value of a Natural Language Generator compared to a plain template engine like Pug.
