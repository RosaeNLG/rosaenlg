=== Added

* in `rosaenlg-packager`, `expandPackagedTemplateJson` will transform a JSON packaged project into plain separate files
* in swagger, added `custom` generic field

== [1.16.1] - 2020-06-24

=== Added

* node API and Lambda API: ability to set a user who has shared templates, which can be rendered by anyone
** see `ROSAENLG_SHARED_USER` for node version 
** see `sharedUser` configuration for Lambda
* node API and Lambda API: render now also gives `templateSha1` in the result


== [1.16.0] - 2020-06-12

=== Added

* on both node.js and Lambda API:
** `/templates/version` to get the current RosaeNLG version deployed
** accepts JWT token for authorisation

=== Fixed

* in the prediction, corrected bug on empty element detection
* Lambda API:
** added `x-rapidapi-proxy-secret` and `x-rapidapi-user` in `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` for preflight CORS
** now supports headers both in upper and lower case
* node.js API: CORS support

=== Changed

* on the node.js API, `reload` is removed; now just using `/templates/\{templateId\}` will always try to reload and give the last SHA1 in the response
* on both node.js and Lambda API, `/templates/\{templateId\}` will now systematically read on backend (and not use cache)


== [1.15.4] - 2020-05-29

=== Added

* migration scripts in `server-scripts` folder

=== Changed

* when rendering, in both node and lamba API: if the proper template/SHA1 is not in the cache but is found on backend, with a different SHA1: you now get a 308 redirect instead of an error (error was `sha1 do not correspond, read sha1 is ... while requested is ...`)


== [1.15.3] - 2020-05-16

=== Added

* French: in revamped module `french-contractions`:
** larger list of "H Aspiré" words
** exceptions for other words: _cet arbre_ vs _ce yahourt_, _le iota_ vs _l'iode_


== [1.15.2] - 2020-05-14

=== Fixed

* clearer exception when `value` of something that is `null` or `undefined`


== [1.15.1] - 2020-05-08

=== Added

* numerous tags now accept lists parameters instead of a single element, and will choose one randomly; use that feature instead of an embedded `syn_fct` call:
** `agreeAdj` and `subjectVerbAdj` now accept a list of adjectives
** `value` accepts a list of elements as first parameter
** `verb`, `subjectVerb` and `subjectVerbAdj` as well for the subject
** `verb`, `subjectVerb` and `subjectVerbAdj` as well for the verb
* `noSubject` flag on `subjectVerb` and `subjectVerbAdj` mixins to silent the subject

=== Fixed

* verbs and adjectives are now properly extracted from `subjectVerbAdj` mixin, when embedding resources
* there were sometimes inopportune `¤` in the html tags
* there were spacing issues when parenthesis and quotes where mixed, like in `bla ("bla") bla`


== [1.15.0] - 2020-05-05

=== Added

* *Spanish support: verbs, words (gender, plural), adjectives, determiners*
* `SEP_BEFORE` and `SEP_AFTER` to provide separators when multiple adjectives; is practical to override default, e.g. `value('árbol', { det:'DEFINITE', adj:{BEFORE:['primero', 'grande'], SEP_BEFORE:''} })` will generate _el primer gran árbol_

=== Fixed

* bug in `BEFORE` adjective list: `value('homme', {det:'INDEFINITE', adj: { BEFORE:['vieux'] } })` now produces _un vieil homme_
* bug in Lambda functions: forced embedded resources (in compile options) were ignored
* bug in `browser-ide-demo`: JSON export was wrong (`templateId` in `src` and not a top level element)
* bug in `french-adjectives` when adjective was placed before noun and plural: generated `vieil alsaciens` instead of `vieux alsaciens`

=== Changed

* *removed `substantive` mixin:* use `value` instead with `number` param, see xref:mixins_ref:value_nominal_groups.adoc[Value for Nominal Groups]
* `english-ordinals` is now a separate module
* `pluralize-fr` removed from tiny runtime (automatically embeds a list of words with their plural instead)
* `french-adjectives` is not embedded no more in tiny version (using lists instead)
* doc organization for verb and value mixins


== [1.14.3] - 2020-04-18

=== Changed

* plugged to `sonarqube`, and thus some code style fixes
* `browser-ide-demo`: 
** warning when load example while code has changed
** auto render by default

=== Changed

* `browser-ide-demo`

=== Changed

* many changes in `gulp-rosaenlg`:
** renamed to `rosaenlg-packager`
** removed `renderTemplateInFile` whose added value was poor
** `packageTemplateJson` changed to `completePackagedTemplateJson`, with a different signature

== [1.13.0] - 2020-03-29

=== Added

* xref:mixins_ref:otherAndHelpers.adoc[ability to include raw js files] (e.g. `include somejs.js`), which is handy to be able to both lint _and_ package these files in a json package

=== Fixed

* clearer exception and message when some raw js in the template is not properly compiled

=== Changed

* xref:integration:gulp.adoc[gulp-rosaenlg] now automatically includes all files to be included by reading the templates content

** `ROSAENLG_FORGET_TEMPLATES`: env variable, if set to true loaded templates will be forgotten after a while (and reloaded when needed)

=== Changed

* `rosaenlg-node-server`: lots of changes in the API, especially sha1 of the template is required to render a template (you get the sha1 when you load the template)

** S3 support for persistence
** ability to put a user in the request, and have separate environments

=== Fixed

* `rosaenlg-node-server`: when using persistent templates, templates were _not_ reloaded when server was restarted

=== Added

* in `rosaenlg-node-server`: ability to render a template directly, by sending the template and the data in the same request

=== Fixed

* the "missing space" issue, which lead to add lines with just `|` or `| &#35;{''}`, is fixed (which is indeed a very good thing)

=== Changed

* *§...§ structure is deprecated*: please use `protect` tag instead which better cares for spacing
* in `rosaenlg-node-server`: removed `counter` in the response (didn't work properly, and was not really interesting)


== [1.5.4] - 2019-12-04

=== Added

* new additional independant module https://gitlab.com/rosaenlg-projects/rosaenlg/tree/master/packages/content-deduplicate[content-deduplicate]; it is not used by RosaeNLG while rendering texts but you can use it afterwards to assess the quality of your texts

=== Changed

* in synonym global optimisation: html tags `div` `p` etc. are not considered no more as words; *this can bring regressions on your projects, as synonyms are better chosen*
* French is better tokenized when there are apostrophes in the text

=== Fixed

* dependancies update

== [1.5.2] - 2019-11-18

=== Changed

* docker images (command line interface and server) are not built through main CI and available https://gitlab.com/rosaenlg-projects/rosaenlg/container_registry[here]

* in `gulp-rosaenlg`, `packageTemplateJson` to bundle templates and included templates in a single Json file

=== Changed

* removed 'fat js' version (was huge, long to produce & not really useful)


== [1.3.1] - 2019-10-18

=== Fixed
