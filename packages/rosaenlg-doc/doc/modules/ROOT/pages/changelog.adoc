== [3.0.2] - 2021-10-19

=== Fixed

* `curl` example is fixed
* checking asm mode for 'paragraph' before throwing a paragraph error


== [3.0.1] - 2021-07-25

=== Added

* `pug_mixins` documentation

=== Fixed

* tok var definition fix in tag function (thanks Mathias Winckel)
* added the exception 'cama' (Spanish gender)


== [3.0.0] - 2021-05-06

It is a major version because there are breaking changes.

=== Added

* you may use RosaeNLG without using templates, accessing directly the low level JavaScript API; support is experimental. See xref:integration:rosaenlg-no-pug.adoc[Usage without Pug templates]
* there are now some "universal tenses" defined, which work for multiple languages; see xref:mixins_ref:verbs.adoc#universal_tenses[Universal tenses table]


=== Changed

*There are 3 breaking changes that affect existing templates.*

==== `ref` and `refexpr` must be reference to mixins

`ref` and `refexpr` must now be reference to mixins (and no more strings), and they must be referenced after being declared.

.Change on `ref` and `refexpr`
[options="header"]
|===
a|
Before
a|
....
- var PRODUCT = {};
- PRODUCT.ref = 'PRODUCT_ref';
mixin PRODUCT_ref(obj, params)
  | the ring
....
a|
After
a|
....
- var PRODUCT = {};
mixin PRODUCT_ref(obj, params)
  | the ring
- PRODUCT.ref = PRODUCT_ref;
....
|===

Your templates will probably fail at runtime if you don't change them. To migrate:

* search for `.ref` and `.refexpr` in your templates
* put references instead of strings
* move them after the referenced mixin declaration

==== when referencing a mixin, assembly separators properties must not use a string

Assembly separators (`last_separator`, `begin_with_general`, etc.) can either be a string or reference a mixin.
When referencing a mixin, you must now put the mixin as a reference (*no more as a string*), and the mixin must have been defined before.

If you don't migrate, your templates will not fail, but *the text will be wrong*: you will have the mixin name in the output.

To migrate, search for all assemblies (`eachz` and `itemz`) and change their properties if they reference mixins.

==== mixins and objects cannot have the same name

Mixins are now functions, which have a name; you cannot have mixins and objects having the same name, e.g.
....
mixin phone
  | bla bla
- var phone = {};
....
is now invalid.

Your templates will probably fail at runtime if you don't change them. Rename conflicting mixins or objects.

=== Fixed

* bug \#47: dates were not properly protected


== [2.1.3] - 2021-01-17

== [2.0.0] - 2020-11-29

`moment`, which was used to format dates, was replaced by `date-fns`, essentially to reduce the size of render only browser bundled packages.

You *must* update `dateFormat` everywhere you used it following link:https://date-fns.org/v2.16.1/docs/format[date-fns format].

Also, `util.moment` not available no more. If you used it, alternatives are:

* import `moment` in your node project and inject moment yourself in `util`
* or prepare dates upstream from generating texts (and avoid `moment` in templates)

=== Added

* issue templates on GitHub
* standard guides: README.md, DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, COMMUNITY.md etc.
* Observable HQ integration doc
* doc on synonyms explaining best approach to generate all alternatives

* bug on context unstack
* big bug on empty synonyms: empty alternatives could be triggered when they contained only spaces

=== Changed

* render only browser packages are smaller (about 1/3 gain).
* `date-fns` is now used to format dates instead of `moment`.
* `util.moment` not available no more.
* `n2words` is packaged more finely to reduce package size.


== [1.20.2] - 2020-11-19

* Java version now supports `ouputData`

=== Fixed

* updated Java version:
** outdated dependencies update

* sonar alerts


== [1.18.1] - 2020-10-31

=== Changed

* github migration:
** all project repositories moved to github, including documentation related subprojects (`antora-ui`, `antora-playbook`, `docs-site`, `boilerplate`): see link:https://github.com/RosaeNLG[RosaeNLG organization on Github]

=== Fixed

* thanks to HB feedback: `#[+subjectVerbAdj('machine', 'être', 'prêt', {det:'DEFINITE', number:'P'})]` now produces _les machines sont prêtes_ (instead of _les machines est prêtes_)

== [1.16.2] - 2020-07-04

=== Added

* in `rosaenlg-packager`, `expandPackagedTemplateJson` will transform a JSON packaged project into plain separate files
* in swagger, added `custom` generic field

== [1.16.1] - 2020-06-24

=== Added

* node API and Lambda API: ability to set a user who has shared templates, which can be rendered by anyone
** see `ROSAENLG_SHARED_USER` for node version 
** see `sharedUser` configuration for Lambda
* node API and Lambda API: render now also gives `templateSha1` in the result


== [1.16.0] - 2020-06-12

=== Added

* on both node.js and Lambda API:
** `/templates/version` to get the current RosaeNLG version deployed
** accepts JWT token for authorisation

=== Fixed

* in the prediction, corrected bug on empty element detection
* Lambda API:
** added `x-rapidapi-proxy-secret` and `x-rapidapi-user` in `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` for preflight CORS
** now supports headers both in upper and lower case
* node.js API: CORS support

=== Changed

* on the node.js API, `reload` is removed; now just using `/templates/\{templateId\}` will always try to reload and give the last SHA1 in the response
* on both node.js and Lambda API, `/templates/\{templateId\}` will now systematically read on backend (and not use cache)


== [1.15.4] - 2020-05-29

=== Added

* migration scripts in `server-scripts` folder

=== Changed

* when rendering, in both node and lamba API: if the proper template/SHA1 is not in the cache but is found on backend, with a different SHA1: you now get a 308 redirect instead of an error (error was `sha1 do not correspond, read sha1 is ... while requested is ...`)


== [1.15.3] - 2020-05-16

=== Added

* French: in revamped module `french-contractions`:
** larger list of "H Aspiré" words
** exceptions for other words: _cet arbre_ vs _ce yahourt_, _le iota_ vs _l'iode_


== [1.15.2] - 2020-05-14

=== Fixed

* clearer exception when `value` of something that is `null` or `undefined`


== [1.15.1] - 2020-05-08

=== Added

* numerous tags now accept lists parameters instead of a single element, and will choose one randomly; use that feature instead of an embedded `syn_fct` call:
** `agreeAdj` and `subjectVerbAdj` now accept a list of adjectives
** `value` accepts a list of elements as first parameter
** `verb`, `subjectVerb` and `subjectVerbAdj` as well for the subject
** `verb`, `subjectVerb` and `subjectVerbAdj` as well for the verb
* `noSubject` flag on `subjectVerb` and `subjectVerbAdj` mixins to silent the subject

=== Fixed

* verbs and adjectives are now properly extracted from `subjectVerbAdj` mixin, when embedding resources
* there were sometimes inopportune `¤` in the html tags
* there were spacing issues when parenthesis and quotes where mixed, like in `bla ("bla") bla`


== [1.15.0] - 2020-05-05

=== Added

* *Spanish support: verbs, words (gender, plural), adjectives, determiners*
* `SEP_BEFORE` and `SEP_AFTER` to provide separators when multiple adjectives; is practical to override default, e.g. `value('árbol', { det:'DEFINITE', adj:{BEFORE:['primero', 'grande'], SEP_BEFORE:''} })` will generate _el primer gran árbol_

=== Fixed

* bug in `BEFORE` adjective list: `value('homme', {det:'INDEFINITE', adj: { BEFORE:['vieux'] } })` now produces _un vieil homme_
* bug in Lambda functions: forced embedded resources (in compile options) were ignored
* bug in `browser-ide-demo`: JSON export was wrong (`templateId` in `src` and not a top level element)
* bug in `french-adjectives` when adjective was placed before noun and plural: generated `vieil alsaciens` instead of `vieux alsaciens`

=== Changed

* *removed `substantive` mixin:* use `value` instead with `number` param, see xref:mixins_ref:value_nominal_groups.adoc[Value for Nominal Groups]
* `english-ordinals` is now a separate module
* `pluralize-fr` removed from tiny runtime (automatically embeds a list of words with their plural instead)
* `french-adjectives` is not embedded no more in tiny version (using lists instead)
* doc organization for verb and value mixins


== [1.14.3] - 2020-04-18

=== Changed

* plugged to `sonarqube`, and thus some code style fixes
* `browser-ide-demo`: 
** warning when load example while code has changed
** auto render by default


== [1.14.2] - 2020-04-11

=== Changed

* `browser-ide-demo`
** added sidebar
** now based on a clean Vue project


== [1.14.1] - 2020-04-06

=== Added

== [1.14.0] - 2020-04-05

=== Fixed

* fixed lambda create which did not save on S3 when the input already contained the compiled content

=== Changed

* many changes in `gulp-rosaenlg`:
** renamed to `rosaenlg-packager`
** removed `renderTemplateInFile` whose added value was poor
** `packageTemplateJson` changed to `completePackagedTemplateJson`, with a different signature
** `compileTemplates` changed to `compileTemplateToJsString`, with a different signature


== [1.13.0] - 2020-03-29

=== Added

* xref:mixins_ref:otherAndHelpers.adoc[ability to include raw js files] (e.g. `include somejs.js`), which is handy to be able to both lint _and_ package these files in a json package

=== Fixed

* clearer exception and message when some raw js in the template is not properly compiled

=== Changed

* xref:integration:gulp.adoc[gulp-rosaenlg] now automatically includes all files to be included by reading the templates content
* as a consequence, in the `packageTemplateJson` function:
** `folderWithTemplates` is removed
** `entryTemplate` must now also contain the path


== [1.12.3] - 2020-03-27

=== Changed

* deprecated `content-deduplicate`

=== Added

* bullet lists for `itemz` and `eachz`, see xref:mixins_ref:eachz_itemz.adoc[doc]

=== Fixed

* `h1` `h2` etc. were not considered as block level html elements

== [1.9.1] - 2020-02-14

=== Fixed

* big bug when `choosebest` was in an `itemz` structure; error message was `choosebest cannot be imbricated`
* removed 2 patches thanks to `n2words` 1.3.2


== [1.9.0] - 2020-02-10

=== Changed

* more reliable `a` / `an` filtering in English: use of `english-a-an` and `english-a-an-list` instead of `compromise` in `rosaenlg-filter`
* more reliable Englisn plurals: use of `english-plurals` and `english-plurals-list` instead of `compromise`

* Italian and Other now available on browser IDE

=== Changed

* use `rollup.js` to package (instead of `browserify`):

== [1.7.0] - 2020-01-20

=== Added

* `rosaenlg-node-server` is now more ready to use on a cluster:
** `ROSAENLG_LAZY_STARTUP`: env variable, if set it prevents loading saved templates at startup (they will be loaded when needed only)
** `ROSAENLG_FORGET_TEMPLATES`: env variable, if set to true loaded templates will be forgotten after a while (and reloaded when needed)

=== Changed

* `rosaenlg-node-server`: lots of changes in the API, especially sha1 of the template is required to render a template (you get the sha1 when you load the template)


== [1.6.2] - 2020-01-12

=== Added

* `rosaenlg-node-server`: 
** better structured JSON logs
** logs using AWS CloudWatch; see doc for config

** env variable `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` becomes `AWS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`


== [1.6.1] - 2020-01-11

=== Fixed

* do not use 1.6.0 as there was an issue in `rosaenlg-node-server`: `winston` must not be `devDependancy`


== [1.6.0] - 2020-01-11

=== Added

* `rosaenlg-node-server`:
** S3 support for persistence
** ability to put a user in the request, and have separate environments
** `/health` path
** time elapsed (performance) in the response and in the logging
** static swagger published link:https://rosaenlg.org/openapi/redoc-static.html[here]

=== Fixed

=== Changed

* `rosaenlg-node-server`: 
** use `get` on `/templates/:templateId` instead of `/templates/:templateId/template` to get template content
** reload all using `/templates/reload` is removed (reload individually each template, or just restart the server)


== [1.5.8] - 2020-01-06

=== Fixed

* `rosaenlg-node-server`: when using persistent templates, templates were _not_ reloaded when server was restarted

=== Changed

* `rosaenlg-node-server`: http codes are now more precise; like in link:https://gitlab.com/rosaenlg-projects/rosaenlg/issues/6[Return 404 instead of 500 when template does not exist]
* `rosaenlg-node-server`: `reload` now uses `PUT` http method, and not `GET` no more


== [1.5.7] - 2020-01-05

=== Changed

* removed `snyk` dependancy

== [1.5.6] - 2019-12-14

*`1.5.5` was not a really good version - please favor `1.5.6` instead.*

=== Fixed

* quotes (`"..."`) are now properly managed in terms of spacing

=== Changed

* removed `filter` mixin: everything is filtered by default; use `protect` mixin to protect sections you don't want to filter
* removed `disableFiltering` option


== [1.5.5] - 2019-12-13

=== Added

* in `rosaenlg-node-server`: ability to render a template directly, by sending the template and the data in the same request

=== Fixed

* the "missing space" issue, which lead to add lines with just `|` or `| #{''}`, is fixed (which is indeed a very good thing)

=== Changed

* *§...§ structure is deprecated*: please use `protect` tag instead which better cares for spacing
* in `rosaenlg-node-server`: removed `counter` in the response (didn't work properly, and was not really interesting)


== [1.5.4] - 2019-12-04

=== Added

* new additional independant module link:https://gitlab.com/rosaenlg-projects/rosaenlg/tree/master/packages/content-deduplicate[content-deduplicate]; it is not used by RosaeNLG while rendering texts but you can use it afterwards to assess the quality of your texts

=== Changed

* in synonym global optimisation: html tags `div` `p` etc. are not considered no more as words; *this can bring regressions on your projects, as synonyms are better chosen*
* French is better tokenized when there are apostrophes in the text

=== Fixed

* dependancies update


== [1.5.3] - 2019-11-24

=== Added

* list of standard stop words in the documentation
* xref:dev_experience.adoc[Developer experience] documentation
* with CLI, templates can now be rendered in stdout (not systematically in a file)
* xref:about:compare.adoc[compare with xSpin]
* xref:about:advanced_nlg_examples.adoc[examples of templates] showing the added value of a Natural Language Generator compared to a plain template engine like Pug

=== Fixed

=== Changed

* Non-breaking space in French punctuation (before `:` `!` `;` and `?`)


== [0.16.0] - 2019-05-11 (private version)

=== Fixed
* `de #[+value(9000)]` (or any number) would contract into `d'9 000`. Now generates `de 9000` properly.
* Punctuation on French and English when using `?` or `!`.
* French possessives issues.

=== Added

* Added dates formatting thanks to http://momentjs.com[moment] lib
* Filtering can be explicitely disabled with `disableFiltering: true` in `renderFile`
* Numbers formatting: use `FORMAT` in `value` to set a format directly used by `numeral`. See http://numeraljs.com/#format[numeral.js formats]. Very practical for currencies, %, etc. For instance `+value(104000, {'FORMAT': '0a$'})` will output _104k€_ when generating French.
* `det` to add a determiner (French and German); current determiners are `DEFINITE` and `DEMONSTRATIVE`.
* It is now easier to complete the `params` object with new values with `addToParams`: `addToParams({xxx:yyy})` is equivalent to `Object.assign({}, params, {xxx:yyy}`.
* `adj` property in `value` to add an adjective.
* `owner` property in `value` to manage possessives. Does the same thing as `thirdPossession`.
* `recordSaid` and `deleteSaid` do not need a `- ` before them no more.

* *Ability to globally choose the best synonymic alternatives with `choosebest`*: see <<choosebest>>.

* Ability to *compile and/or just render texts in browser*, without using `node.js`. See <<inbrowser>>.
* Tutoriels can be run directly in the browser.

* *Improved French support*, see below.
* *Partial support of German (`de_DE`)*, see below.

* Ability to generate Yseop templates. Yseop is a NLG software vendor. See <<yseop.adoc>>.

==== French

* Cardinal numbers in letters (5 -> cinq etc.) support thanks to https://github.com/yamadapc/js-written-number#readme[written-number] lib
* Numbers formatting:
** Basic support for French ordinal numbers: `+value(1, {'ORDINAL_NUMBER':true })` = _1er_ thanks to `numeral` lib
** Support for French cardinal numbers up to 100: `+value(21, {'ORDINAL_TEXTUAL':true })` = _vingt et unième_
* Improved French verbs support:
** Any verb of all 3 verb groups are available thanks to `lefff` derived resource.
** Supported tenses: `PRESENT` `FUTUR` `IMPARFAIT` `PASSE_SIMPLE` `CONDITIONNEL_PRESENT` `IMPERATIF_PRESENT` `SUBJONCTIF_PRESENT` `SUBJONCTIF_IMPARFAIT` `PASSE_COMPOSE` `PLUS_QUE_PARFAIT`.
** For `PASSE_COMPOSE` and `PLUS_QUE_PARFAIT`: use `aux` property (`ETRE` or `AVOIR`) and `agree` property: `elles #[+verb(getAnonFP(), {verb: 'sortir', tense:'PASSE_COMPOSE', aux:'ETRE', agree: getAnonFP()})]` generates _elles sont sorties_. If `aux` is not set, some rules will apply (transitive verbs rather take `AVOIR`, etc.).
** Use `pronominal:true` for pronominal form.
* French gender shortcuts:
** `setRefGender(PRODUCT, 'bague');` will look for `bague` in the dictionnary and set `PRODUCT` gender to `F`.
** `#[+value('bague', {represents: PRODUIT})]` will output _bague_ *and* set the gender of `PRODUIT` to `F` via the dictionnary.
* French contractions:
** now manage _ce/cet_: _ce arbre_ becomes _cet arbre_
** manages "h aspiré": _le hérisson_ vs _l'hebdomadaire_
* French adjectives:
** `adjPos` in `value` to set the position of the adjective
** manages "h aspiré":
*** `#[+value('homme', {det:'INDEFINITE',  adj:'vieux', adjPos:'BEFORE'})]` outputs _un vieil homme_
*** `#[+value('hollandais', {det:'INDEFINITE',  adj:'vieux', adjPos:'BEFORE'})]` outputs _un vieil hollandais_
* Very simple integrated POS tagger-like to simplify syntax: `#[+value('<un vieil hollandais>')]` (or `#[+value('<une vieux hollandais>')]`) outputs _un vieil hollandais_. See <<value.adoc#simplified>>.


==== German

* German is `de_DE`.
* Ponctuation (like English).
* Dates and numbers.
* Gender of words (M/F/N) thanks to https://github.com/languagetool-org/german-pos-dict[german-pos-dict].
* Cases thanks to `german-pos-dict`.
* Determiners.
* `getMFN` helper (makes the same job than `getMorF`).
* Possessives (_die Farbe der Gurke_).
* Adjectives (_der alten Gurke_).
* Very simple integrated POS tagger-like to simplify syntax: `#[+value("<der alte Gurke>", {case:'GENITIVE'})]` outputs _der alten Gurke_. See <<value.adoc#simplified>>.
* Verbs thanks to https://github.com/languagetool-org/german-pos-dict[german-pos-dict] - all tenses are supported

=== English
* determiners and possessives (`thirdPossession`)


=== Changed

** `REPRESENTANT: 'ana'` renamed to `REPRESENTANT: 'refexpr'`
* Updated librairies and linguistic resources documentation: see <<index.adoc#resources>>
* Replaced `better-title-case`, which was deprecated on npm, by `better-title-case`. Changed the test case (titlecase rules seem to be complex).
* `monthName(date)` (which generated the name of the month _january_ _february_ etc.) is deprecated as we now have `moment` lib. Use `#[+value(date, 'MMMM')]` instead.
* Removed `format-number-french` (replaced by `numeral`).
* Removed `jslingua` (replaced by custom lefff extract).
* `valWithUnit` is deprecated and removed.
* `loadDict` param is removed; ressources a just loaded when necessary.
* Removed `registerSubst`. Use `setRefGenderNumber` directly.
* updated many libs: copyfiles mocha rimraf better-sqlite3 compromise moment written-number

=== Fixed
* no changes - just fixin Lerna

== [0.15.5] - 2018-04-21

=== Added
* performance documentation

=== Fixed
* Sub modules are now referenced via their exact version number (no more `^...`). It will be easier to use fixed versions of RosaeNLG (with their dependencies) in the future.

== [0.15.4] - 2018-04-20

=== Fixed
* French support for month names did not work - fixed
* `getNextRep` (used in French) didn't work properly: the chosen representant was often not the one that `getNextRep` had predicted.

=== Changed
* mostly refactoring

=== Fixed
* pug `render` did not work - fixed.
* doc is now also generated in one single large PDF file

== [0.15.0] - 2018-04-14
=== Added
* to raise the probability of a specific synonymic alternative to be triggered, use `syn {weight:4}` (4 times higher chances - default is 1)
* to force a specific synonym to trigger, use `synz {force:3}` (to trigger the 3rd one)
** this is useful while developping
** `force` is not compatible with `{mode:'sequence'}`
** if the forced alternative is empty, it will still not trigger it

=== Changed
* `synz 'sequence'` syntax is not valid no more: use `synz {mode:'sequence'}`
* changed the random algorithm: it is still random but does not provide exactly the same numbers as before; *you shall update your regression tests* (and I'm sorry for that).
* `defaultSynoType` renamed to `defaultSynoMode`
* `setSynoProps`, `setSize`, `getSize` removed

....
eachz elt in elts with { separator: ',', last_separator: 'and' }
  | #{elt}
....

== [0.12.0] - 2018-04-09

== [0.11.0] - 2018-04-09
=== Added
* new `protect` structure tag that acts like `protectString`, to exclude some text from the filtering process:
....
  l
    protect bla.bla
....

* wrong path in `include node_modules/rosaenlg/main.pug`

== [0.10.0] - 2018-04-05

*RosaeNLG is now a fork of Pug and not only a Pug add-on.* Usage is easier, but maintenance is not.

=== Changed

* easier integration:
** include lib via `const rosaenlgPug = require('rosaenlg');`
** then any pug method can be called, for instance `rosaenlgPug.renderFile`
** no more (visible) `NlgLib` object
** in your template, use `include node_modules/rosaenlg/main.pug`
* automatic filtering unless `noFilter` is set to `true`

=== Added
* new boolean parameter `noFilter` if don't want to automatically filter the whole outputs
* new structure keywords:
** `synz` / `syn` to define synonyms: replaces `+assemble`
** `itemz` / `item` to define list of items: replaces `+syno_sentences`

=== Fixed
* `a` could be transformed into `the` by compromise in some situations

.New syntax example: assemble
....
- setSize('listElts', 2)
mixin listElts(pos)
  case pos
    when 1
