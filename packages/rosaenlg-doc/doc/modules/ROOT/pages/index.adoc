== Introduction

RosaeNLG is a Natural Language Generation library for node.js or client side (browser) execution, based on the https://pugjs.org/[Pug] template engine. It was previously known as FreeNLG.

Fully supported languages (with grammar, gender etc.) are *English*, *French*, *German*, *Italian* and *Spanish* but you can generate texts in any other language with less features.

RosaeNLG is complete enough to write production grade real life NLG applications.

RosaeNLG is a https://lfaidata.foundation/[Sandbox Project of LF AI & Data Foundation], part of the Linux Foundation.

== Where to start

To start, use the xref:quickstart.adoc[Quick Start] and **the xref:tutorials:intro.adoc[Tutorials and Examples]**. Then read carefully and respectfully the xref:mixins_ref:intro.adoc[Reference Documentation].

If you wonder about NLG, see xref:about:nlg.adoc[What is NLG] and xref:about:usecases.adoc[its usecases].
You can also check the xref:about:features.adoc[detailed characteristics of RosaeNLG].

https://rosaenlg.org/demos/demos.html[French demos] are available.

You can xref:quickstart.adoc#docker[run RosaeNLG in docker].

You can also play around with a client side editor, compiler and renderer with an https://rosaenlg.org/ide/index.html[in browser editor] or directly here:

p
  eachz fruit in data with { separator: ',', last_separator: 'and', begin_with_general: 'I love', end:'!' }
    | #{fruit}
`, 'I love apples, bananas, apricots and pears!'
);
