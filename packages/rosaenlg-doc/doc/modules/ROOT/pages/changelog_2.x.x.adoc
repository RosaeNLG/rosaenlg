== [2.0.0] - 2020-11-29

`moment`, which was used to format dates, was replaced by `date-fns`, essentially to reduce the size of render only browser bundled packages.

You *must* update `dateFormat` everywhere you used it following https://date-fns.org/v2.16.1/docs/format[date-fns format].

Also, `util.moment` not available no more. If you used it, alternatives are:

* import `moment` in your node project and inject moment yourself in `util`
* or prepare dates upstream from generating texts (and avoid `moment` in templates)

=== Added

* issue templates on GitHub
* standard guides: README.md, DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, COMMUNITY.md etc.
* Observable HQ integration doc
* doc on synonyms explaining best approach to generate all alternatives

=== Fixed

* browser IDE demo: German is blocked when using Firefox (https://github.com/RosaeNLG/rosaenlg/issues/3)
* bug on context unstack
* big bug on empty synonyms: empty alternatives could be triggered when they contained only spaces

=== Changed

* render only browser packages are smaller (about 1/3 gain).
* `date-fns` is now used to format dates instead of `moment`.
* `util.moment` not available no more.
* `n2words` is packaged more finely to reduce package size.
