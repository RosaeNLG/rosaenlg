== [0.17.0] - 2019-06-29 (private version)

=== Added

* first support of Italian (no verbs)
* basic support on any language
* `INDEFINITE` determiner type in German

=== Changed

* Non-breaking space in French punctuation (before `:` `!` `;` and `?`)


== [0.16.0] - 2019-05-11 (private version)

=== Fixed
* `de &#35;[+value(9000)]` (or any number) would contract into `d'9 000`. Now generates `de 9000` properly.
* Punctuation on French and English when using `?` or `!`.
* French possessives issues.

=== Added

* Added dates formatting thanks to http://momentjs.com[moment] lib
* Filtering can be explicitely disabled with `disableFiltering: true` in `renderFile`
* Numbers formatting: use `FORMAT` in `value` to set a format directly used by `numeral`. See http://numeraljs.com/#format[numeral.js formats]. Very practical for currencies, %, etc. For instance `+value(104000, {'FORMAT': '0a$'})` will output _104k€_ when generating French.
* `det` to add a determiner (French and German); current determiners are `DEFINITE` and `DEMONSTRATIVE`.
* It is now easier to complete the `params` object with new values with `addToParams`: `addToParams({xxx:yyy})` is equivalent to `Object.assign({}, params, {xxx:yyy}`.
* `adj` property in `value` to add an adjective.
* `owner` property in `value` to manage possessives. Does the same thing as `thirdPossession`.
* `recordSaid` and `deleteSaid` do not need a `- ` before them no more.

* *Ability to globally choose the best synonymic alternatives with `choosebest`*: see <<choosebest>>.

* Ability to *compile and/or just render texts in browser*, without using `node.js`. See <<inbrowser>>.
* Tutoriels can be run directly in the browser.

* *Improved French support*, see below.
* *Partial support of German (`de_DE`)*, see below.

* Ability to generate Yseop templates. Yseop is a NLG software vendor. See <<yseop.adoc>>.

==== French

* Cardinal numbers in letters (5 -> cinq etc.) support thanks to https://github.com/yamadapc/js-written-number#readme[written-number] lib
* Numbers formatting:
** Basic support for French ordinal numbers: `+value(1, {'ORDINAL_NUMBER':true })` = _1er_ thanks to `numeral` lib
** Support for French cardinal numbers up to 100: `+value(21, {'ORDINAL_TEXTUAL':true })` = _vingt et unième_
* Improved French verbs support:
** Any verb of all 3 verb groups are available thanks to `lefff` derived resource.
** Supported tenses: `PRESENT` `FUTUR` `IMPARFAIT` `PASSE_SIMPLE` `CONDITIONNEL_PRESENT` `IMPERATIF_PRESENT` `SUBJONCTIF_PRESENT` `SUBJONCTIF_IMPARFAIT` `PASSE_COMPOSE` `PLUS_QUE_PARFAIT`.
** For `PASSE_COMPOSE` and `PLUS_QUE_PARFAIT`: use `aux` property (`ETRE` or `AVOIR`) and `agree` property: `elles &#35;[+verb(getAnonFP(), {verb: 'sortir', tense:'PASSE_COMPOSE', aux:'ETRE', agree: getAnonFP()})]` generates _elles sont sorties_. If `aux` is not set, some rules will apply (transitive verbs rather take `AVOIR`, etc.).
** Use `pronominal:true` for pronominal form.
* French gender shortcuts:
** `setRefGender(PRODUCT, 'bague');` will look for `bague` in the dictionnary and set `PRODUCT` gender to `F`.
** `&#35;[+value('bague', {represents: PRODUIT})]` will output _bague_ *and* set the gender of `PRODUIT` to `F` via the dictionnary.
* French contractions:
** now manage _ce/cet_: _ce arbre_ becomes _cet arbre_
** manages "h aspiré": _le hérisson_ vs _l'hebdomadaire_
* French adjectives:
** `adjPos` in `value` to set the position of the adjective
** manages "h aspiré":
*** `&#35;[+value('homme', {det:'INDEFINITE',  adj:'vieux', adjPos:'BEFORE'})]` outputs _un vieil homme_
*** `&#35;[+value('hollandais', {det:'INDEFINITE',  adj:'vieux', adjPos:'BEFORE'})]` outputs _un vieil hollandais_
* Very simple integrated POS tagger-like to simplify syntax: `&#35;[+value('<un vieil hollandais>')]` (or `&#35;[+value('<une vieux hollandais>')]`) outputs _un vieil hollandais_. See <<value.adoc#simplified>>.


==== German

* German is `de_DE`.
* Ponctuation (like English).
* Dates and numbers.
* Gender of words (M/F/N) thanks to https://github.com/languagetool-org/german-pos-dict[german-pos-dict].
* Cases thanks to `german-pos-dict`.
* Determiners.
* `getMFN` helper (makes the same job than `getMorF`).
* Possessives (_die Farbe der Gurke_).
* Adjectives (_der alten Gurke_).
* Very simple integrated POS tagger-like to simplify syntax: `&#35;[+value("<der alte Gurke>", {case:'GENITIVE'})]` outputs _der alten Gurke_. See <<value.adoc#simplified>>.
* Verbs thanks to https://github.com/languagetool-org/german-pos-dict[german-pos-dict] - all tenses are supported

=== English
* determiners and possessives (`thirdPossession`)


=== Changed
* Some speed optimizations (which are not significant)
* Refactoring: switched to TypeScript for most of the code
* Some renaming: *please impact your templates*
** `shuffle` renamed to `mix`
** `REPRESENTANT: 'ana'` renamed to `REPRESENTANT: 'refexpr'`
* Updated librairies and linguistic resources documentation: see <<index.adoc#resources>>
* Replaced `better-title-case`, which was deprecated on npm, by `better-title-case`. Changed the test case (titlecase rules seem to be complex).
* `monthName(date)` (which generated the name of the month _january_ _february_ etc.) is deprecated as we now have `moment` lib. Use `&#35;[+value(date, 'MMMM')]` instead.
* Removed `format-number-french` (replaced by `numeral`).
* Removed `jslingua` (replaced by custom lefff extract).
* `valWithUnit` is deprecated and removed.
* `loadDict` param is removed; ressources a just loaded when necessary.
* Removed `registerSubst`. Use `setRefGenderNumber` directly.
* updated many libs: copyfiles mocha rimraf better-sqlite3 compromise moment written-number



== [0.15.6] - 2018-04-21

=== Fixed
* no changes - just fixin Lerna

== [0.15.5] - 2018-04-21

=== Added
* performance documentation

=== Fixed
* Sub modules are now referenced via their exact version number (no more `\^...`). It will be easier to use fixed versions of RosaeNLG (with their dependencies) in the future.

== [0.15.4] - 2018-04-20

=== Fixed
* French support for month names did not work - fixed
* `getNextRep` (used in French) didn't work properly: the chosen representant was often not the one that `getNextRep` had predicted.
* anaphoras: after forcing referential representant output, the next one was still the representant; now it is the anaphoric one.

=== Changed
* mostly refactoring
* `syno_sentences` mixin deprecated, use `synz > syn` structure
* `assemble` mixin deprecated, use `itemz > item` structure


== [0.15.3] - 2018-04-17

=== Changed
* global filtering is done automatically unless any filtering was been done during generation via `filter` mixin
* `noFilter` parameter is deprecated

=== Fixed
* pug `render` did not work - fixed.
* doc is now also generated in one single large PDF file

== [0.15.0] - 2018-04-14
=== Added
* to raise the probability of a specific synonymic alternative to be triggered, use `syn {weight:4}` (4 times higher chances - default is 1)
* to force a specific synonym to trigger, use `synz {force:3}` (to trigger the 3rd one)
** this is useful while developping
** `force` is not compatible with `{mode:'sequence'}`
** if the forced alternative is empty, it will still not trigger it

=== Changed
* `synz 'sequence'` syntax is not valid no more: use `synz {mode:'sequence'}`
* changed the random algorithm: it is still random but does not provide exactly the same numbers as before; *you shall update your regression tests* (and I'm sorry for that).
* `defaultSynoType` renamed to `defaultSynoMode`
* `setSynoProps`, `setSize`, `getSize` removed

== [0.14.1] - 2018-04-12

  | what is this thing?
....
* FYI the https://www.npmjs.com/package/titlecase[titlecase npm package], which is used in en_US, is no longer maintained

== [0.13.0] - 2018-04-09
=== Added

....
eachz elt in elts with { separator: ',', last_separator: 'and' }
  | #{elt}
....

== [0.12.0] - 2018-04-09

* `main.pug` is included automatically so do not include it yourself explicitely in your templates no nore.

== [0.11.0] - 2018-04-09
=== Added
* new `protect` structure tag that acts like `protectString`, to exclude some text from the filtering process:
....
  l
    protect bla.bla
....


== [0.10.8] - 2018-04-08
* just testing the release process - nothing changed

== [0.10.7] - 2018-04-08

== [0.10.0] - 2018-04-05

*RosaeNLG is now a fork of Pug and not only a Pug add-on.* Usage is easier, but maintenance is not.

=== Changed

* easier integration:
** include lib via `const rosaenlgPug = require('rosaenlg');`
** then any pug method can be called, for instance `rosaenlgPug.renderFile`
** no more (visible) `NlgLib` object
** in your template, use `include node_modules/rosaenlg/main.pug`
* automatic filtering unless `noFilter` is set to `true`

=== Added
* new boolean parameter `noFilter` if don't want to automatically filter the whole outputs
* new structure keywords:
** `synz` / `syn` to define synonyms: replaces `+assemble`
** `itemz` / `item` to define list of items: replaces `+syno_sentences`

=== Fixed
* `a` could be transformed into `the` by compromise in some situations

.New syntax example: assemble
....
- setSize('listElts', 2)
mixin listElts(pos)
  case pos
    when 1
      | A

....
t
  synz
    syn
      | A
    syn
      | B
....

== [0.9.2] - 2018-03-29

=== Added

== [0.8.1] - 2018-03-26

=== Added

=== Fixed
- a / an transformation was triggered in all languages, fixed to English only

== [0.6.0] - 2018-03-20

** user function `isNotEmpty()` to tell a specific structure is not empty.
** new mode for synonyms: instead of choosing them randomly, you can trigger then in sequence (first then second etc.). Use `setSynoType('syno mixin name', 'sequence')` to do that. See <<mixins_ref.adoc#synonyms_sequence>>
