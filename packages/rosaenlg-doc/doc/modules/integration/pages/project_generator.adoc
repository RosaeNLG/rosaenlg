= RosaeNLG node.js project generator

Use link:https://yeoman.io[yeoman] along with RosaeNLG generator to bootstrap automatically a new standard node.js RosaeNLG project.

It follows (my) best practices so that you can quickly start your own RosaeNLG project.

It is based on the content of the English tutorial.

== Generate a project

* install yeoman: `npm install -g yo`
* install RosaeNLG generator for yeoman: `run npm install -g generator-rosaenlg`
* create a folder to will contain your project, and go in that folder
* run `yo rosaenlg`

This will create a blank standard RosaeNLG projet. If you have existing templates in json file, use `unpack` option: e.g. `yo rosaenlg --unpack chanson.json`.

== Generating texts

Just use `gulp texts` to generate the texts in `dist` folder.


== Data load and pre processing

At some point you have to load into data and also pre process it. You can use `init.js` for that.


== Templates organisation

One possible organization for your templates:

* `phoneForHtml.pug` and `phoneForJson.pug` are technical entrypoints: they are almost the same, and mainly call the `phone` mixin
* `includes.pug` centralizes all your includes: this is handy when you refactor
* `phones.pug` is the real entrypoint for NLG: it generates the text for a phone
* `phone_refexpr.pug` contains the reference and referring expressions for phones. Create one file per object you describe (`car_refexpr.pug`) etc.
* sentences (most of the textual content) are in `sentences`:
** one file per sentence: `colors.pug` generates the sentence about the colors, `intro.pug` is the introduction sentence etc.
** If you have longer sentences and paragraphs you should create a more sophisticated hierarchy, but *I recommend to keep 1 file per sentence*.


== Testing

You should (really) have some regression testing on your texts. It just compares texts with reference texts previously generated. 

* Use `gulp nonreg` to regenerate the reference file in `tests/phonesNonreg.json`. It contains texts along with the random seed (the same random seed has to be used when running the tests).
* Run the tests using `npm run test` or `mocha`
