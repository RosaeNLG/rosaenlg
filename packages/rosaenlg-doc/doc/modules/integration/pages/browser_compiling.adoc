= Client side in browser compiling and rendering

Both compilation and rendering are made in the browser: templates can be authored directly in the browser, or dynamically generated, compiled in the browser and the texts can also be rendered in the browser.

To be able to do that, you must use a js version of RosaeNLG that is larger, with `\_comp` at the end, like `rosaenlg_tiny_fr_FR_*\_comp.js`:

* it includes the templates compiler
* but also all linguistic resources that are associated with a language

TIP: Client side compilation is for exotic usecases. You should favor server side compilation.

It can be used to create a 100% client side editor and renderer, https://rosaenlg.org/ide/index.html[like in this demo].

Works with Firefox and Edge, but not with older IE.

WARNING: German version with compiling does not work under Firefox (probably due to the huge size of the file), but works on Chrome and Edge (recent versions).


== Packaged version of RosaeNLG for client side usage

RosaeNLG provides browser ready tinyified packages per language in `dist/rollup`:

* 2 packages per language: classic (rendering only) and `\_comp`. `\_comp` version can compile templates. For browser usage, you should compile the templates upstream and use the classic version, as the `\_comp` are very large.
* `en_US` rendering only version is a little larger as it includes `a/an` linguistic resource.
* the German version with compilation support is huge.
