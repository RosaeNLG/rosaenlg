The https://rosaenlg.org/ide/index.html[browser IDE] is actually not a real IDE but is handy to develop simple RosaeNLG templates.

Develop templates:

* Start by choosing an example template. *Be careful as it will replace your current template.*
* Make some modifications and push the `Render` button. Generated texts will appear on the right.

You can switch to another language.

Export/save options:

* use `Save template` to download a plain text file containing your template; reload using drag and drop over the editor
* use `Export > As JSON` to download a JSON package of your template; this package can be deployed on a RosaeNLG API
* use `Export > As compiled JavaScript` to export your template as a plain JavaScript function (`for node.js` is the same but adds a `export default` at the end to be able to use the JavaScript as a node module)
